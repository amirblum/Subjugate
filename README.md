Subjugate
=========

An awesome GGJ14 game

This game was created for the Global Game Jam 2014 event. The intention of the git is to continue honing some of the games features and getting it to the vision we had originally thought of.

The game is made with Unity3D 4.3. You may compile the game on your own machine. 

The controls are:
Left/Right arrows - Move around world counter-clockwise/clockwise
Up arrow - Jump!
Control key - Subjugate the nearest enemy!

The rules are:
You can only subjugate the closest enemy within your line of sight.
You can destroy enemies only with subjugated enemies of the same type
Don't let the enemies hit your house!!
